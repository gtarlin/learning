                    These pumpkin cookies are a favourite from my childhood. As a kid I enjoyed them each year when my mom made them in the fall. As an adult I discovered that it's possible to make them at any time of the year. The recipe
                    card that I got from my mom originally called for chocolate chips rather than raisins. Not the same. Don't do it. I love chocolate as much as the next person, but the beauty of these cookies is in the raisins. Good call,
                    mom!
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    The recipe card also says that the recipe makes "about 5 dozen" cookies. I always double the recipe when I make it, but I still don't get five dozen cookies. It saddens me a little to think of all the extra work of
                    spooning out those tiny little drops onto the sheet when you'll just grab a handful every time anyway. Save yourself the effort and make these cookies massive. If made properly eating three of these should spoil your
                    next meal.

                        I just noticed that the <u>rubric</u> for this assignment requires that I demonstrate some styling for quotes. I don't feel like trying to work a natural quote into this fake blog entry so I'll just include an
                        unrelated quote instead.
