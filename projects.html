            <p>These pumpkin cookies are a favourite from my childhood. As a kid I enjoyed them each year when my mom made them in the fall. As an adult I discovered that it's possible to make them at any time of the year. The recipe card that I got from my mom originally called for chocolate chips rather than raisins. Not the same. Don't do it. I love chocolate as much as the next person, but the beauty of these cookies is in the raisins. Good call, mom!</p>

            <p>The recipe card also says that the recipe makes "about 5 dozen" cookies. I always double the recipe when I make it, but I still don't get five dozen cookies. It saddens me a little to think of all the extra work of spooning out those tiny little drops onto the sheet when you'll just grab a handful every time anyway. Save yourself the effort and make these cookies massive. If made properly eating three of these should spoil your next meal.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup cooked pumpkin</li>
                    <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup oil</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>2 cups flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda dissolved in </li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon milk</li>
                    <li>1 cup raisins</li>
                    <li><s>1/2 cup nuts (optional)</s></li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Combine pumpkin, sugar, oil and egg. Stir together flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt; add to pumpkin mixture along with dissolved soda and mix well. Stir in raisins, nuts and vanilla. Drop by teaspoonfuls on lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated 375 oven 10 to 12 minutes. Makes about 5 dozen.</p>

                        <p>The recipe calls mentions an optional 1/2 cup of nuts. I've never tried this. Feel free if that's your thing.</p>
